## A small, fast, and dirty file transfer utility
Elix is a memory safe file transfer utility similar to croc written in pure Rust. 

Elix in latin translates to a drain or a ditch; oftentimes carrying shit. This naming denotes that elix is meant as a learning project and therefore is very unstable and prone to failure.
